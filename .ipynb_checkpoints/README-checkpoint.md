# Machine Learning Challenge
> This project is my personal learning process during the 100-Day-Coding-marathon held in Taiwan, 2019. 

- Participants needs to complete one task about ML every day, and finish 3 Kaggle post- competition finally.

- The homework-folder is messy, so I extracted all the important information as a series of notes, which can help me recall the fundamental theory of Machine Learning

- Also, it is a useful code snippet for starting a machine learning projects on my work, saving me a lot of time searching and copy paste for the repetitive code lines.

- The notes were written by Traditional Chinese. So if you have any idea, PR Welcome!
